			<h3 class="chicken">Chicken</h3>
		    <p>Typically, chicken should be fried for about 7-8 minutes per side. But keep in mind that pieces can vary in size and thickness. The chicken is fully cooked when the thickest part of the meat registers at 165Â° and the skin is crispy and dark golden-brown in color.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<h3 class="beef">Beef</h3>
		    <p>It's pretty hard to beat the comfort and satisfaction that you get from eating a bowl of curry, especially when the beef is deeply crisped and tender, the rice is piping hot, and the sauce is well-spiced. Well - we have good news - this recipe is exactly that. </p>

			<h3 class="sushi">Sushi</h3>
		    <p>This is the traditional way to roll any type of rolled sushi, which is called maki sushi. There are actually two options for this method: rolling with the sushi rice on top of the sheet of nori, as we do here; or with the nori flipped over so the rice ends up on the outside of the finished roll.</p>
